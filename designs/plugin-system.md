# Plugin System 
```
  The Plugin System which should power the bot itself. 
  It consits of an Event Loop, it has Discord Events, Custom and Lifetime Events.
  
  On Startup the Start Level provided by the plugin determines the startup order of the plugins, 
  the order is from the lowest to the higest, so the lowest level starts first. 
  
  
  On Shutdown the Stop Level also provided by the plugin determines the stop order of the plugins,
  the order is like from the startup, the lowest stops last.
  
  The Plugin defines it's config and the methods for handling start, start and events
